The user Bob have just seen the movie "Horrible Bosses" and earlier he
had watched the movie "Dinner for Schmucks" and wants to recommend "Horrible Bosses"
for those who have seen the "Dinner for Schmucks" or vice versa.

Bob creates a relationship/recommendation between these movies and write a short review (with score) why
he thinks that people that have seen one of the movies should watch the other.

Other users can now up- or downvote Bobs review which modify Bobs trust score which is
used when he up- or downvotes others relationship reviews. This means that users who have
a higher trust score have larger impact when they vote on relationships.

Because other users also may write their own reviews for the same relationship the review
with the best score (based on votes + trust score of each voter) is the relationship 
and comment that're used for the relationship/recommendation.
